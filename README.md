# Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning (mCPP)
## Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing a coverage path planning strategy for a multi-robot formation in a V-shaped formation. The goal is to maximize coverage area and minimize the travel time of the formation using a forward-backward sweeping method.

## Objectives
- Develop and implement a multi-robot coverage path planning (mCPP) strategy.
- Maximize the coverage area.
- Minimize the travel time of the V-shaped formation.

## Methodology
- **Formation Control**: Utilize a V-shaped formation for the robots.
- **Coverage Strategy**: Implement a forward-backward sweeping method to ensure complete area coverage.
- **Optimization**: Focus on optimizing the travel path to reduce time while ensuring maximum coverage.
